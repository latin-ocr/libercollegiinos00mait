THE PREFACE.

sixth Penitential Psalm, “ De Profundis”⁵ together with the appointed
orisons.G

Both the College itself, and the houses bequeathed forits endow-
ment, were to be kept in good repair, in roofs‚ windows, and walls (⁵⁶ in
tegulis, vitro, lye poyntyng”)‚ at the sight of the bailies of the city, under
the care of a Master of Work, to be chosen, from the number of the pre-
bendaries, in their yearly chapter at Whitsunday.⁷

The strict observance of the Foundation was anxiously provided for.
The Dean of the cathedral chapter, with one of the canons of the metropo-
litan church to be elected by him, and the Rector, with the Dean of thc
Faculty of Arts‚ of the University‚ were appointed Visiters of thc College‚
receiving payments for their service, and armed with power to correct
the faults of the members by summoning them before the Provost, in the
first instance, or, in the event of his failing to enforce amendment, then
before the Dean and chapter of the High Kirk3 the punishment of any

prebendary guilty of incontinence being reserved to the ordinary of the

diocese and his commissaries.⁸

Domine, exaudi vocem meam. Fiant aures tuae
intendentes, in vocem deprecationis meae‚'' etc.
In the Vulgate it is numbered as Psalm cxxix. ; in

observcd, they furnish unquestiouable proof of the
general “ depravity of the priesthood’' at that time,
it should be remembered that they afford equal evi-

Four visitations were to be made in every

denec ofthe existence of an earnest desire, 011 the
part of the better members of the church herself,
to amend the prevailing immorality. I may refer
any one who wishes to follow the traceS, which
present themselves in so many quarterS, of a
party within the Scotish church zealous for her old
faith and observances but equally zealous sor a
reform in the lives and manners of her clergy, to
a remarkable tract (Ι believe of great rarity)
printed at Paris in the summer of 1540, with the
following title: “ Ad Illustriss. Tit. S. Stephani
in monte Coelio Cardinalem. D. Dauidem Betoun,
Primatem Scotiae, Archiepiscopum S. Andreae,
Episco. Meripocensem, De fcelici accessione dig-
