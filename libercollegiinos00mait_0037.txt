ancient name of Saint Thenaw’s Gate. No memorial either of the form
01· size of the edifice has been preserved: we know only that it was sur-
rounded by a burying ground,8 and that on the west side of it stood the
Song School. For more than a quarter of a century after the Reforma-
tion, the church lay waste3 but, about the year 1592, it began to be
again frequented as a place of worship. Its history, from that period to the
close of the seventeenth century, may be traced in the copious exn-acts
from the Registers of the Kirk Session of Glasgow, which have been pre-

served by Wodrow in his inedited “ Life of Μι- David Weemes.'’⁰ It

and square, not sur from the site of the edifice
which marked the testing place of the royal matron
who gave birth to the Apostle os Cumbria.

Saiut Thenaw lent her name also to a spring and
a streamlet in the neighbourhood of her church.

Glasgow, ranxxxwa—MDCCL„ p. 239.) 1 have
been told that, within the memory ot man, Saint
Theuaw's Well was not unfrequently resorted to
with feeliugs in which devotion might claim to
hold a part.

Saint Thenaw‘s Gate was the site of other two
chapeIS‚ the one dedicated to the Blessed Virgin,
the other to Saiut Thomas of Canterbury, arch-
hishop and martyr.

Saint Mary‘S, or Our Lady Chapel, stood on
the north side of the street, not sar from the
Market Cross. Its existence can be traced as sar
back as the year 1293. It would seem to have
fallen into ruin after the beginning of the six-
teenth century. See below, pp. 87, 117, 244;

We have record of the Chapel of Saint Thomas a
Becket, in the year 1320, when Sir Walter Fitz Gil-
bert, the progenitor of the Hamiltons, bequeathed
to the cathedral a suit of vestments for a priest,
deacon, aud subdeacon‚ under provision that they

might be borrowed, if required,four times in every
year sor the service of Saint Mary’s chapel at Ma—
chan, and twice yearly for the use of the chapel of
Saint Thomas the Mai-tyr at Glasgowmamely, on
the festival of his commemoration, being the fourth
day after Christmass, and on the feast of his
translation, being the seventh of July. (Registrum
Episcopatus Glasguensis, vol. i. pp. ⁴227. 2¹28.)
Mention is made of the building in the year 1505.
See below, p. 258.

The erection of a Nunnery, dedicated to Saint
catherine of Sienna, was conlciuplated in the
neighbourhood of Saint Thenaw’s Chapel; but it
does not appear that any measure was taken
towards the execution of the design, beyond a
bequest by Roland Blacader, subdean ofGlasgow‚
of the sum of three hundred pouuds. See Ap-
pendix to the Presuce, No. I.

enacted in the year 1577, it was “ordanit that
