offerings and orisons to be made by them for the soul of John Earl of Len-
nox, whom Hamilton had slain in cold blood, on the field of Linlithgow,
upon the fourth of September 1526.⁹

Between the first and last yearS‚ during which Friar Lyle ruled the
brethren, two other Priors appear to have been interposed.

the Friars Preachers of Glasgow‚’' is admitted to the privileges of the

“The Earl of Lenox, they found lying slain
ernelly, by Sir James Hamilton that tyrant, after
that he was taken in the field by the laird of Par-
dovan, and his weapons taken from him. Sir
James Hamilton slew him without morey, and so

that day.' '’ (Lindsay of Pitseottie‘s Hist. of Scot.,

Buchanan relates a bold attempt of one of
Lennox's grooms to revenge his master's death, by
assassinating the Bastard at the palace gates of
Holy Rood, in the midst of two thousand of his
follow-ers, Douglasses and Hamiltons, in arms.
