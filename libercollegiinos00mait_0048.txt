xliv THE PREFACE.

In the following year, King Robert the First bestows on the convent,
a yearly payment of twenty merks from his rents of Cadyow in Clydes-
dale. The grant, which was made at Ayr‚ is witnessed by the King's
brother, Edward de Erus, Earl of Carriok, and Lord of Galloway3 by the
King’s nepheW, Sir Thomas Ranulph, Earl of Murray3 by Walter, the
Steward of Scotland3 and by the good Sir James of Douglas.¹

A donation by a burgess of Glasgow, which, though without date,
must be referred to this period,2 is of interest, as supplying the first men-
tion that has been observed of a name and place which the commercial
enterprise of later times has made widely known. “ Seven rigs of land
lying in the field of BRoMILAw, between the land of Sir Walter of Roule
on the east, and the land of Saint Mary, which is held by Sir John
VVyschard, on the west3 also another rig lying in the same field, between
the land of Sir 'Walter of Roule on the west, and the land of Agnes
Broune on the east3 which eight rigs Martin Sutor now holds and possesses‚
for a term of four years from Martinmas next, at the rent of five shillings
sterling a year;” three rigs of land lying ln the Croupis3 a tenement in
the Gallowgate3 six shillings and “ two days in harvest,’' being the yearly
rent of a house in the High Street; forty pence yearly from a tenement in
the Fishergate3 and five shillings annually from a house on the north side
of the Friar’s‘ Place or Cloister: all these, does John of Govan give, grant,
and confirm to the Friars Preachers of Glasgow, ‘⁴ for the good of his own
soul, of the souis of his predecessors and successors, and of all the faithful
departed, and to the praise and glory of Almighty God, the Glorious
Virgin Mary, and Saint John the Evangelist, in honour of whom the
church of the said Friars is named.”.³
