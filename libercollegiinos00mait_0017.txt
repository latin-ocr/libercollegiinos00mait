benefice and cure, the name of which may be familiar to the members of
the Club, as the scene, two centuries afterwards, of the pastoral labours
ofthe zealous Wodrow, namely, the vicarage of Eastwood, in the deanery
of Rutherglen. About the year 15277 he succeeded Roland Blacader
as Subdean of Glasg0w3 and this dignity‚ to which the rectory of the
parishes of Cadder and Monkland was attached, hc continued to
hold during his life.
in the year 1534, and filled the office, by successive re-elections‚ until

the year 154l.⁸ By the latter will of Archbishop Dunbar, who died in

1547, he was appointed one of the executors of that learned and muni-

ficent churchman‚ of whose confidence and affection he enjoyed a large
share. To him specially was entrnsted the erection of the stately
sepulchre of brass which covered the Archbishop’s grave in the chancel of
the cathedral.⁰ He was charged also with the endowment and regulation
of the obsequies and yearly commemoration to be performed for the soul's

‘⁷ Roland Blacader appears as Subdcan of Glas-
gow on the twenty-second of April. 1524, (pp. 81,
82) having held that dignity so early as the year
1503. (Registrum Episcopatus GlasguensiS, vol. ii.
p. 506.). He is recorded in the Obituary of
Glasgow to have survived the year 1540, (id.
p. 615); but, if there be not a mistake in this date,
he must have resigned the Subdeanery many
years previously. James Houstoun appears as
Subdean in May 1527, (below, pp. 55, 87); and
continues to be so designated‚ throughout the
long series of dceds which fill the subsequent

century.
