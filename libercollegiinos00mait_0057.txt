THE PREFACE. liii

the Provincial of England, appointed Vicar General of the order of The first Prior

Saint Dominio in scotland? and this kingdom itself having been

Friar William Knokis governed the brethren of Glasgow but for a
short time. He is found in only one deed of the series, an instrument of

seisin of the year 1471, from which we learn that a cemetery adjoined the

his order for thirty years, and to have survived
the Reformation. (T. Dempsteri Historia Ec-
clesiastica Gentis Scotorum,tom. i. p. 330. edit.
Edinb. 1829). Cf. Father Hay’s Scotia Sacra,
p. 626. MS. Adv. Bibl. Edinb. He was Prior
of the convent at Aberdeen, in the year 1516
(Registrum Episcopatus Aberdonensis, vol. ii. pp.
311-313,), and is commemorated by Boece as one
of the nien of learning and piety who adorned the
early years ofthe University of that city: “ Ioan-
nes GrysoniuS, Robertus Insulanus, ct Alexander
Aulicus praedicatorii instituti viri theologi spec-
tabiles scientia et pietate.'·‘ (H. Boetii Episcopo-
rum Murthlacensium et Aberdoneusium Vitae.
sol. xxviii. E prelo Ascensiano, 1522). As Pro-
vineial of the Friars Preachers, Gryson was one
of the churchmen who sat in judgment on the
heresy of Patrick Hammon, in 1528. (Arch-
bishop Spottiswoode’s Hist. of the Chureh and
State of Scotland, p. 63.).

Under the year 13:29, the Chronicle of the
Priory of Lanereost records, that “eodem anuo·
obtinuerunt Fratres Scotti vicarium quemdam
Generalis Ministri, et a Fratribus Angliae totaliter
sunt divisi.” (Chronicon de Lanercost, p. 265.
Edinb. 1839. Presented to the Maitland Club
by Archibald Campbell of Blythswood‚ esq.>.
The learned editor in his index (p. xxxvi.) refers
this notice to the Fratres Praedicatores; but there
can scarcely be a doubt that it applies to the
Fratres Minores, the order to which the chronicler

last is said by Dempster to have been Provincial of himself belonged.

Provincial of the
Dominicans in

ereeted into a province before the year 1487? he became its first Prior scotland.

Friar William
Knokis.
