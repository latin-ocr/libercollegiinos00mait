the general store of our ecclesiastical antiquities; but it is, unquestionably,
in a narrower point of regard, as illustrating the old topography os the
City of Saint Kentigern, that their chief importance will be found. In this
belief, I have printed, in the APPEND1x‚ a selection from the more curicus
or instructive of the great mass of deeds which are preserved in the char-
ter room of the University, regarding lands and houses within the burgh.

To turn these documents (with the records which they accompany, and
the much more important contents of the “Registrum Episcopatus Glas-
guensis”) to their full account, is a pleasing labour which must be reserved
to the local antiquary‚ when one qualified for such a duty shall arise to

rescue the history of Glasgow⁷ from the hands of ignorance and incapacity

⁷ M‘Ure's book, though the oldest, is yet
the best which we have on the subject. It
is, at the same time, only too obvious that, even
if he could have had access to the records
from which the annals of the city must bc written,
he was without the knowledge necessary either
to read or to understand them. His mistakes,
gross as they are, have been, for the most part,
implicitly copied by his successorS, few of whom
were more competent than himself, and some,
indeed, were still more illiterate.

Ι have not considered it necessary, in the prc—
ceding pageS, to detain the reader by adverting to
the many erroneous statements regarding Our
Lady College and the Blackfriars' Convent, which
are to be found in the historias of Glasgow. It may
suffice to say here, that Ι have written with these
works before me, and that 1 have rejected nothing
which they advance, except for reasons which Ι
believe to be sufficient.
