xviii THE PREFACE.
The fourth prebend‚ that of Saint Mary the Virgin, was endowed with

the rents of certain lands and houses in the town and suburbs. Its
patronage belonged to the bailies and council of the city3 the collation,
to the Archbishop.⁵

To the fifth prebend, styled after Saint James the Apostle, were
assigned the rents of divers tenements within the burgh, and two acres of
land in the common moor. The election of the prebendary was in the
bailies and council: he was to be admitted by the Provost of the College.

The sixth prebend was designated after Saint Roche or Rocque, a
confessor of the fourteenth century, to whose intercession the popular belief
ascribed many instances of miraculous deliverance from the terrors of the
plague.G The prebendary‚ beside certain payments from houses within the
burgh, had assigned to him the lands belonging to the Church of Saint
Roche, in the moor of Glasg0w3 in which he was bound, thrice a-week, to
say mass and other offices used and wont, “for the soul of its founder, of wor-
shipful memory, Thomas Mureheid, prebendary of Stobo.'’ He was farther
required (with the consent of the bailies and council of the city, patrons
of Saint Roche’s, and of Nicholas Witherspowne, its chaplain)‚ to be present
with the other prebendaries of Our Lady College, at Matius, High Mass,
Vespers, and Complin, and to take part with them in these offices, except
at such times as he was obliged to perform service at Saint Roche's. The
prebendary was to be chosen by the bailies and council of the city, and

to receive institution from the ordinary of the diocese.⁷
