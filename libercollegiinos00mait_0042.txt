THE PREFACE.

xxxviii

Monarch's wis'n : it seems at least certain that the King, who died within
fifteen years after the canonization of Saint Dominio in 1234, founded no
fewer than eight houses of the order, namely‚ at Ber-wick-upou-the-Tweed‚
at Perth, Ayr, Stirling, Aberdeen, Edinburgh‚ Inverness, and Elgin in
Murray.⁷ During the same reign, or in the earlier years of the suceeeding
sovereign‚ a convent was planted at Glasgow3 the Maiden of Galloway
built another at Wigton 3 the Earls of Fife established a third at Cupar 3
a fourth was ereeted at Montrose hythe great northern house of the Ostiarii
or Durwards; and, at a period not long Subsequent, a fifth, in the ecclesias-
tical capital of the kingdom, owed its foundation to the bounty of William
Wischard‚ bishop of Saint AndreWS.S

According to a tradition of the order, which survived the Reforma-

tion, ‘⁴ thair Place in Glasgw wes biggit and foundit be the Bischop and

Cheptour.”⁹
