THE PREFACE.

XXV

Saint Anne's day, and on the morrow; the bells of the College were to be

rung, and images and wax lights were to be set out in the choix-3 and for

for. the year 1578, there is a charge of two shillings
“ for ane tong to Sanct Mungowis bell.’' (Burgh
Records of the city of Glasgow, nummu.—
Manxxr.‚ p. 104.) An author, who is not how-
ever of the best credit, affirms that the relic sur-
vived even the beginning of the reign of King
Charles I.: “Glascuensis ciuitas pro stemmate
habet salmonem huiusmodi, necnon et campanam
(quae in hodiernum vsque diem a Glascuensibus
asseruatur) qua vir Dei vtebatur.'‘ (Davidis
Camerarii De Scotorvm Fortitvdine Doctrina. et
Pietate, p. 83. Paris. 1631.). This is the latest
trace of Saint Mungo’s bell which has occurred to
me: it may have perished in the destruction of
‘⁵ superstitious monuments’‘ which was made not
long afterwards, when (as we learn from the Kirk
Sessiou Register) the reforming ardour of the year
1641 busied itselfin effacing from the walls of the
cathedral the last Iingeringinscription of· euntia ·
quintinum · ure· pto · nohis ·

The devotion felt for the ·‘ campana Sancti
Kentigerni’' was not the only instance of that
kind of observance which obtained in Scotland.
The Breviary of Aberdeen commemorates a cer-
tain 13811, “ quoddam tintinnabulum,” which Pope
Gregory the Great presented to Saint Ternan the
Apostle of the Picts. (Breuiar. Aberdon.‚ Prop.
Sanct., xij. Junii.). It was preserved, with many
other relics of the saint, at the church which was
built over his grave at Banchory on the northern
Dee; and legal deeds of the fifteenth century arc
extant to show the importance which was attached
even to the custody of“ the bcll of Sanct Ternen
callit the Ronecht.” (Registrum Recentius Cenobii
de Aberbrothoc‚ MS. Bibl. Adv. Edinb.; Regis-
trum Episcopatus Aberdonensis, vol. i. pp. 327,
328). Ronecht was, perhapS, a. name generally
given to bells brought from the Eternal city. (See
Illustrations of the Topography and Antiquities
of the shires of Aberdcen and Banff, p. 253.

Aberdeen, 1846.). The “ sacra campana Sancti
Kessogii‚” and the “ sacra campana Sancti Lolani”
were included among the feudal investitures of the
Earldom of Perth so lately as the year 1675.
(Inqvisitionvm ad capellam Domini Regis retor-
natarvm Abbreviatio, inquisit. special. vicecomit.
Perth. nn. 708, 880, 1094. Edinb. 1811). In
days still more recent we are told how the bell
of Saint Fillan in Glendochart, “that was in
high reputation among the votaries of that saint
in old times, has for some years past been locked
up, to prevent its being used to superstitious pur-
poses.³' (Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. xvii.
pp. 877, 378. Ediub. Noa).

Giraldus Cambrensis may be cited to show that,
in the twelfth century, the superstitious venera-
tion of bells was general, not only in Scotland,
but in Ireland aud Wnles. ‘⁴ Hoc etiam non
praetereundum puto,” hc says ¹⁴ quod campanas
baiulus, baculosque Sanctorum in superiore parte
recuruos, auro et argento vel acre contectos, in
magna reuerentia tam Hiberniae et Scotiae quain
et Gwalliae populus et clerus habere solent: ita
vt sacramenta super haee longe magis, quam super
Euangelia‚ ct praestare vereantur et peierare,''
(Topographia Hiberniae‚part.iii. cap. xxxiii„ apud
Anglica, Hibernica, Normannica, Cambrica, a
veteribvs Scripta ex bibliotheca Gviliclmi Cam-
deni, p. 747. Francos. 1602). In the same work
(part. ii. cap. xxxiii. p. 729), hc commemorates the
miraculous bell of Saint Finian at Clonard in
Leinster; aud in another, hc records the marvel-
lous powers of a bell preserved in the church ol'
Glascum at Elenein in Wales: ‘⁴ campana baiula
virtuosissima‚ qnam proprio vocabulo Bangu vo-
cant, quae et Sancti Dauid fuisse perhibetur?
(Itinerarium Cambriae, lib. i. capp. i., ii. pp. 822,
825.; Cambriae Descriptio, cap. xviii. p. 891.)

Saint Mungo’s bell, though every trace of its
story appears to have long vanished froin the

Saint Mzmffls Bell.
