THE PREFACE.

and so the corporation was absolved from the suit which had been raised

against it.⁶

The site of the Collegiate Chureh of Saint Mary and Saint Anne, was

on the south side of the Trongate‚⁷ then more commonly known by its

G Appendix to the Preface, No. ΙΙ.

7 1 have not observed the occurrence of the
name of ‘⁶ The Trou Gate'' before the middle of
the sixteenth century, that is about sixty years
after King James IV. (by his chartei· of the fourth
of January 1489-90) granted to the Bishop of
Glasgow, and his successore, the privilege of hav-
ing τι free tron in their city: ‘⁴ liberam facultatem
et potestatem et libertatem quod fieri faciant
habeant teneant et possideant liberum tronum in
dicta civitate pro perpetuo ac constituant et ordi-
nent custumarium tronatorem et clericum cokkete
in eadem vt omnes mercancie et bona civibus et
tenentibus civitatis et buronie de Glasgu perti-
nentia ibidem tronentur ponderentur et custumen-
tur.” (Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis, vol.
ii. p. 467.). In a deed of seisin of the tliirtieth of
May 1545, a tenement is described as being “in
le Troyne Gait ex parte australi eiusdem‚” (MS.
in archivis Alme Universitatis Glasguensis;
Blackh. Invent. no. ⁶251). In the following
sheets (pp. 3, 7, 131, 132), the name of “lie
Troyngait ” is given, in writings of the year 1549,
to the same street which, less than twenty years
previously, was called Saint Thenaw’s Gate. In
the Registrum Episcopatus Glasgucnsis, the name
ot ‘¹ Troingaiw first occurs on the third of October
1553, (vol. ii. p. 580.)

The street derived its older name, by which
it was known at least as early as the year 1426
(see below p. ⁶244), from a chapel situated near its
western extremity, dedicated to Saint Thenaw,
the mother os Saint Kentigern. The Breviary
of Aberdeen (which was printed in 1509) assures
us that this devont lady died and was buried at

Glasgow (Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensismol.
i. p. xcviii.); and we have the express authority of
a royal declaration in the previous century for be-
lieving that this chapel was built over her sepulchre.
King James 111„ by a charter dated on the
fourteenth of October 1475. bequeathed to the
cathedral church of Glasgow half a stone of wax,
from the lands of Odingstoune in the lordship of
BothweH, sor lights to he burned at the tomb of
Saint Tencw, in the chapcl where hcr bones were
buried: “dimidiam petram cerc fiendam et dis-
tribuendam super sepultura dicte Sancte Tcnew
ac constructione super eadem sepultura facta in
capella vbi ossa hujusmodi Sancte requiescunt.”
(ld. vol. ii. pp. ties-428.) Another deed, of the
year 1498, makes mention also of the ‘⁵ capella
ubi ossa Beate Thanew matris beati confessoris
Kentigerni requiescunt prope civitatem Glas-
guensem.'' (ld. vol. ii. pp. 497499.) We learn,
however, from a catalogue of the relies in the
treasury of the cathedral in the year 1432, that
at least some of the bones of Saint Thenaw
were kept there along with the remains of her
distinguished son: ‘¹ Item duo sacculi linei cum
ossibus Sancti Kentigerni Sancte Tenaw et alio-
rum diuersorum „sanctorum” (Id. vol. ii. p. 330.).
Saint Thenaw's Chapel survived the year 1597;
and some traces of it were to be found even so
recently as the beginning of the last century.
VVodrow records that it was then called ‘⁸ Saint
Tennoch’s;” a name which, in the mouths of
a people more familiar with thc Prophets of the
Antediluvian World than with the Saints of the
Dark Ages, was in no long time changed into
that of “Saint Enoch‚¹’ now given to a church
