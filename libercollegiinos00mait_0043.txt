Of the Muniments of the Friars Preachers which are printed in the Bulls of Pope
following sheets, the earliest in point of time is a Bull of Pope Innocent hmocem IV.
1V.‚⁴ in the year 1244, empowering and enjoining the ordinaries of
dioceses to grant the benefit of absolution and the grace of dispensation

Preachers of Glasgow had begun to build.⁵
