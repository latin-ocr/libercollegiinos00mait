THE PREFACE. xliii

Preachers‚ a spring called “ The Meadow Well,” with the right of con-
ducting it into their cloister, from its source in the Deanside.⁵ This place
yet retains the appellation which it bore five hundred years ago; and in
the plentiful waters which still flow from it, we may, doubtless, recognise
the fountain of the warlike churchman's gift, though all traces of its pristine
state have been obliterated by the streets and alleys of the teeming city,

and nothing but the old name is left to suggest

“ Quanto praestantius esset

Numen aquae, viridi si margine clauderet undas
Herba.”

Hitherto the convent seems to have kept by the original vow of
the order, ‘⁶ bearing the burden of voluntary poverty for Christ’s sake.'’G
But now it began to share in the long series of those endowments which
in the end exposed the Preaching Brethren to such reproaches as
we find recorded by Buchanan: “Dominicanis nequaquam eadem erat
opulentia, sed certe tanta, ut mendicitatis professionem facile falsam
redargueret, adeo ut non inscite quidam non Fratres Mendicantes sed
Manducantes eos appellaret.” ⁷

Guyllascop MacLachlan of Argyll, by a charter dated from his tower Grant of forty
of Castle Lachlan, on the shore of Loch Fyne, on the Saturday before {Zillzuegscyhssfrlg}

Glasgow (which began on the sixth of July, being the Octave of Saint
Peter and Saint Paul the Apostles, and lasted for eight daysss), the other
