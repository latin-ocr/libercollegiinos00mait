chosen for that purpose yearly, by his brethren, on the Feast of Saint Mar-tin

in winter; and he was to take to himself, for his fee, twenty pennies.

Glasg„ vol. i. p. xc.). The Cistercian of Furnes
devotes the sixth chapter of his book to the same
tradition: ‘⁴ De igne per invidiam a sociis Sancti
Kentegerni extincto, et flatu ejus celitus in ramus-
culo corili dato.” (Pinkert. Vit. Antiq. SS.
scotiae, pp. elo-212). He adds, that the super-

natural power which was put forth on this occasion,

had not altogether ceased to manifest itself even in
his own day: “ Corilus enim illa, de qua ramusculus
scissus est, benedictionem a Sancto Kentegerno
accepit, quae postmodum in nemusculum silvescerc
cepit. Si vero de corileto illo, nt patriotae dicunt,
ramusculus etiam viridissimns assumptus fucrit,
quasi aridissimum quid ad tactum ignis quodam-
modo lambentis, usque in hodiernum diem ignem
suscepit, et modico afflatu pulsatus per meritum
Sancti igneam comam ex se spargit.''

We meet with the original miracle (together
with those of the resuscitation of the tarne robin
of the Apostle of the Orkneys, and the recovery,
in the fish's mouth, of the lost ring of the srail
Quecn of Caidyow) in the Sequentia er hymn
for the feast of Saint Kentigern in the Missal pre-
sented by the Kuight of Arbuthnott, in the year
1492, to the church which he had founded in
honour of the first bishop of the Picts:

“ Garrit ales pei-necatus

Ardent rami congelati
Sacro flatu inflammati

Mecha merens confortatur

Regi reconciliatur

Dum in fluctu quijactatur

Piscis profert annnlum.''

(Liber Ecclesie Sancti Terenani de Arbuthnot,
MS. penes Dominum Vicccomitem de Arbuth-
nott.). According to this vener-able record of
the traditione of the Scotish church, Saint Mungo
was baptized by the hands of Saint Palladius.

Thus, the hymn for the festival of that bishop Arms of the city ιη’
and confessor (whom the collect commcmorates Glasssoua

as “ Scotorum populo primum Apostolum et
Doctorem catholice fidei”) recites:
‘¹ Sentis fidem predicunit:
Terenanum baptizauit
Presulcm sanctissimum.
Kentigernurn fonte lauit:
Et Seruanum ordinauit
Suum suffraganeum.”

lfear that the mono, Lm* GLASGOW FLOURISH
ΒΥ run rnmcmno or THE worm, which now
accompanies the armorial bearings of the city,
cannot be traced to any very remote perio‹l; else
for this, likewise, a fanciful origin might, perhaps,
be suggested in the legend that tells how Saint
Kentigern, having appointed Saint Asaph to the
rule of the sce in Wales, which still hears that
disciple's name, was warned of an angel that he
himself should again go down to Glasgow; how
King Rerlrath, with his chiefs and a great multi-
tude of people, went out to welcome the rcturning
prophet; how he began to preach to them the
word of God, but from the press and throng could
neither be seen nor heard save hythe few who
stood nearest by; and how, of a sudden, the earth
on which he stood miraculously upheaved itsclf
into a knoll, so that all the assembled thousands
both beheld his countenance and heard his words.
The story is in the liturgy which good Bishop
Elphinstone (himself born and bred within the
patrimony of Saint Mungo) compiled for the use
of his church of Aberdeen (Regist. Episc. Glasg.
vol. i. p. xciii.); and the record adds, that achapel
dedicated to the honour os the Saint was erected
on the spot: ‘¹ Et dum eisdem predicaret verbum
Dei a parua parte populi visus est nec sermo
eius auditus est. Vnde nutu divino terra supra
quam stetit se in monticulum eleuauit ita ut ab
