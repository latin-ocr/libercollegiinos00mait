was Christopher Boyd, vicar of Dalry‚³ and its last, Archibald Crawfurd‚
rector of Eglesham,⁴ the same person, apparently, who is mentioned in the

will of the Founder‚ as “his most dear friend.” For some time after the

great ecclesiastical revolution which was consummated in the year
1560, the revenues of the church would appear ‘to have been enjoyed by
the surviving prebendaries.⁵ As these died out, the endowments gradually
fell into the hands of the municipal corporation of the city3 and seem, in no
long time, to have been applied, wholly 01· in part, to its common and
secular purposes. In the year 1593, the right and possession of the
burgh were challenged by Sir Patrick Houstoun of that Ilk, knight,
on the assumption that the Founder had established a provision by
which the lands and rents of the College, in the event of their being
diverted from their proper destination‚ should “pei-tene and returne
to the Laird of Houstoun and his airis for evir, but forder proces or

pley.” No such clause, however, was to be found in the Foundation;

once confounded the Collegiate Church of Saint

Crawsurd, who seems to have conformed to the

new ecclesiastical' establishment‚ survived the

1574. the town council “ ordanit the commoun pro-

work of the New Kirk,” (p. 8.).
