His claim, which 118 15 50 83181111 10 place on
record, to the 11118 01 “ 1118 11151 Provest 11131 1185
in Glasgw,” arose, doubtless, from the erection of
thc city into a regalhy, by the char-ter of King
James 11.‚ dated at Edinburgh on the twentieth
os April 1450. (Registrum Episcopatus 0135-
guensis, vol. ii. pp. 375-377; vol. i. p. lv.).
Hitherto it had been merely a burgh of barony,
holding of the Bishop, governed by bailics ap—
pointed by him, and as such, exposed to occa-
sional annoyance from its more highly privileged
neighbours, the burghs royal of Rutherglcn, Ren-
frew, and Dunbarton. (Acta Dominorum Audito-
rum, p. 9. Edinh. 1845.; Local Reports of the
Commissioners on the Municipal Corporations
of scotland, vol. ii. pp. 3-5. Lond. 1835.) It
was not until the year 1636, that, in the words
of the authority last cited, “it may be said with

propriety that the city os Glasgow was first placed

Ineed scarcely add, that, whatever difficulty
there may be in determining all the functions of
the “ prepositi'’ who are found administering the
affairs of the burgh in the thirteenth century,
it is sufficiently certain that their office was very
different from that of the “provost” of subse-
quent ages. A deed in the Chartulary of Glas-
gow, runs in the name of ‘⁸ Oliverus et Ricardus

5 Saint catharine of Sienna, 3 111111 of the order
os Saint Dominic, died in the year 1380, and was
canonizcd by Popc Pius ΙΙ. 111 1118 year 1461.
The devotion in which she was held hythe order
of the Friars 1’reachers, is ridiculed by Erasmus
in 1115 Dialogue of the Shipwreck: “ Auromcs.
Quid actum 851 dc Dominicano? Anom’uus. Is,
ut idem narrabat, implorata divorum ope, abjectis
vestibus, nudum se commisit natationi. ΑΝΤ.
Quos divos invocabat? AnoL. Dominicum,
Thomam‚ Vincentium, et nescio quem Petrum,
sed in primis fidebat catharinae Senensi. Awr.
Christus illi non veniebat in mentem? Αῡοι.

sinon abjecisset sacram cucullam: ea deposita.
qui potuit illum agnoscere Catharina Senensis?”
