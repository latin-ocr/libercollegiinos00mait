A subsequent clause of the Foundation prescribes the office of the
Lesser Sacrist, who was to be elected by the Provost and prebendaries.
Beside waiting on the Sacrist Major, and assisting him in his duties, in a
fair surplice‚ he was bound to be present at Matius, High Mass, and
Vespers, both on Sundays and on other holidays of observance3 to ring the
bells at such hours as should be appointed by the College3 to light the
candles, and tomhes, and to put them out, in due season3 to place the
vestments on the altar3 to open and shut the church doors, and to keep
their keys.¹

The third prebend was named in honour of Saint Anne. The pre-
bendary was required to be learned and expert in playing on the organ,
and to perform on it daily according to the use and wont of the metropo-
litan church. He was bound also to keep a Song School for the instruc-
tion of youth in plain-song and descant. His benefice was the rent of a
house in the street called the Walcargate (now known as the Saltmarket).
He was to be nominated by the bailies and council of the city, and to
be admitted to his office by the Provost of the college? We learn inci-
dentally from a subsequent page,³ that the Song School stood on the west
side of the church3 and traces of its existence occur for more than half a

century after the Reformation.⁴¹
