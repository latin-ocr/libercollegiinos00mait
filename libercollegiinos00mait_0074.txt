to which it has hitherto been resigned. I might have wished to attempt
one or two observations on some of the more memorable localities of the
ancient archiepiscopal town3 but these prefatory remarks have been already
too far prolonged3 and I would hope that the pains which have been
taken with the INDEX OF PLAcEs, may serve to make that, in so far as it

goes, a not unsafe guide to the reader.

It remains only to refer to the subjoined TABLE OF Conrnnrs, as
indicating at once the dates of the several deedS, the sources whence they
have been derived, and the manner in which they are exhibited in the
following pages. It will readily be understood that, where a charter or
other document is printed in an abridged form, the abbreviation has been
effected by the rejection of merely technical phrases, or clauses alto—
gether of common form. Nothing which can be regarded as material in
any point of view, has been omitted3 and the language and orthography

of the original record have, in all instances, been faithfully preserved.
