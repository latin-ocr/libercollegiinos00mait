Bulls of Pope
Cleinent IV.

xl THE PREFACE.

1252, when King Alexander ΙΙΙ. issued his letters patent to the bailies
of Dunbarton commanding them to pay ten pounds yearly, from the rents
of that burgh, to the Friars Preachers of Glasgow, in lieu of the Kiug’s
obligation to find them in food for one day in every week.⁶

More thau half a century elapses before we meet with the record of
any increase to this slender revenue, the only deeds of intermediate date
being two Bulls of Pope Clement IV„ in the year 1265, in favour of the
institute at large. By the first of these, the successor of Saint Peter pro-
nounces sentence of excommunicatiou upon all persons daring to offer
violence to the churches or places of the brethren;⁷ by the second, he
proffers a hundred days' indulgence to all the repentant faithful who shall
go in devotion to the churches of the Friars Preachers, on the anniver—
saries of their dedication, or on the festivals of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
Saint Dominic the confessor, Saint Peter the martyr,⁸ and the other saints
held in veueration by the order.⁹

From incidental notices which have been preserved, we learn that
during the reign of King Alexander ΙΙΙ., the Friars Place in Glasgow
was surrounded by a wall, and gave its name to a neighbouring wynd or

vennel,l probably the same which, two centuries afterwards, came to be

called by the name of the Gray Friars of the order of Saint Francis.

Β Peter of Verona, a Fri-ar Preacher, martyred
near the city of Milan in the year 1252, was
canonized iu the following year by Pope Innocent
IV. His office in the Roman Breviary is on the

1 In the year 1270, a house bequeathed to the
vicars choral of the cathedral,by the subdean,
Robert of Lanark‚ is described as “proximior
Fratribus Predicatoribus in villa Glasguensi inter

ipsos Fratres et domum Willclmi de Bellidstane.’'
(Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis, vol. i. p.
181.). About the year 1290, Finlay Jager, bur-
gess of Glasgow, sells to Sir James of Reinfru,
chaplain, a house and garden in Glasgow, “in
vico qui se extendit a muro Fratrum Predicatorum
sursum versus Castrum, a parte australi vici pre-
dicti.'’ (Id. vol. i. p. 198.) A few years later,
Alan, the sacristan of the cathedral chureh, leaves
to his successors in office ¹¹ totam illam terram que
