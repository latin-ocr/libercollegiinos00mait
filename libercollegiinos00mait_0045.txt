THE PREFACE.

In the autumn of 1301, the Friars Preachers had to give harboury sojourn, iu tho
Convent, ofKing

within their precinct, for three days, to King Edward Ι. of Eugland, who Edu-ard 1. of

spent the greater part of that year in bringing the western shires of Ens‘lflssd·
The Accounts of his Wardrobe show that
the hospitality of the brethren was requited with a payment of six shil-

dierum in mora Regis ibidem3 per manus Fratris Johannis de wrotham,
apud Botheuille‚ sexto die Septembris: vj solidi.”‘-' The convent of the
Preaching Friars was, doubtless, the only place in the city capable of
receiving the royal retinue, else, perhaps, we might be allowed to suppose
that it was made choice of by the King on account of the spacious splen-

dour for which the buildings of the Dominicans generally were famous in

that age.3

Remembrancer at Westminsteir, a roll of the same
year (aoth King Edw. 1.‚ 20 Nov. 1300—19 Nov.

manufactured for King Edward's use at Glasgow:

And presed to the Prechoures to proven her wille.

Ich higbed to her house, to herken of more,

And when I came to that court, Ι gaped about,

Swich a bild bold ybuld upon erthe heighte

Say l nought in certeyn syththe a long tyme.

Ι yeniyd upon that hous, and ycrnc theron loked,

Whow the pileres weren ypaint and pulched ful

And queyntly ycorven, with curious knottes,

With wyndowes wel ywrought wyde up alofte:

And than I entred in, und even forthe wente,

And all was walled that wonc, thought it wiid

With posternes in privite to passen when hem

Orcheyardes and erberes euesed wel elene.

Crede (written about the year 1390) describes the
precinct, chureh, cloister‚ chapter house, fratery,
dormitory, and infirmary of a Dominican convent:

‘¹ Thau thought I to frayne the first of this foure
ordres‚

Than Ι munte me forthe the Mynstere to knowen,
And awayted it anon wonderly wel ybild,

With arches on everich half and bellyche ycorven
With crochetes on corneres with knottes of gold
Wyde wyndowes ywrought ywriten ful thikke.
