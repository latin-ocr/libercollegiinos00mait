filled with such devices as never fail, in any age, to gain the many “ who
will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts heap to themselves
teaohers‚ having itching ears, and turn away their ears from the truth,
and be turned unto fables.”³ Hence it was that both the Dominicans and
their rivals, the other great Mendicant Order which took its name from
Sain't Francis, rose so suddenly in the popular affection and estecm, that, in
the words of Matthew Paris, himself a Benedictine, “the Monks did not, in
three 01· four hundred years, ascend to such a height of greatness as the

Friars‚ Minor-s and Preaehers‚ within twenty-four years after they began

to build their first house in England.

The progress of the Preaching Friars in the northern region of the

island, was scarcely less rapid.

They found a munificent patron in the

⁴‘ Saint Dominic's character as a preacher‚‘' says
a living writer, “was to introduce pithy stories,
something in the way of Rowland Hill, but with
still less, probably, of gravity or reverence. His
disciples imitated his practice; and if we may
trust the account of an Italian religious poet,
who lived in the same century with Dominio,
their artifices by such means to catch the applause

of their hearers were paltry enough:

¹* Christ said not to the convent of His twelve,

‘ Go forth, and preaeh buffooncries to the world‚'
But gave them truth to build on ; and the sound
Was mightier on their lips than shield or spear.
The Preacher now provides himself vaith stote
ijests aud gibes ς and ifhis hearers langii,

His big cowl swells with pride, and all goes riglit.”

length by Bishop Lavington of Exeter, in a work
which cnjoycd no small popularity during the last
century,and has been reprinted within these thirty
years. The late Poet Laurcate has left an expres-
sion of his regret that in the reformed Anglican
communion “ no attempt was made to substitute
something for the Mendicant Orders, and to incor-
porate an auxiliary force for the service of the
national church: perhaps if this had been done,
the Puritans would never have set these king-
doms in a flame3 certainly, VVesley and White-
field would, like Francis and Dominic, have found
their place, and Methodism would have kept
within the bounds to which the founders, notwith-
standing their sincere wish, were not: able to
confine it.” (The Quarterly Review, vol. xxii.

sage occurs. by a note in his Book of the Church,
