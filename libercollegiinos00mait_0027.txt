prescribed with great minuteness. Firstly, on every Feast of Saint Anne
(the twenty-sixth of July), all the eleven prebendaries of the College‚
with the three choristers, were to assemble between the hours of three
and four in the afternoon, to sing “Placebo'’² and “Dirige,’‘³ to read
the nine Iessons (from the book of Job) appointed in the Office for the
Departed, to say the Psalm “De Profundis,” and the accustomed prayers
and collecte. This ended, three shillings were to be distributed among
them, in bread and ale. On the morrow, each prebendary was to celebrate
a mass of Requiem, when eleven shillings were to be divided equally among
the canons, and each chorister was to have four pennies. Secondly, thirty
of the poor, old men and matrons, were to be gathered in, both to the obse-
quies on Saint Anne’s day, and to the mass on the m01·rOW‚ taking their
place on a wooden bench in the middle of the choir set apart for the images
and wax lights, and receiving, each ofthem, three pennies in wheaten bread,

three pennies in flesh or fish, and two pcnnies for ale. Thirdly, along with

Archibaldi Hayi. 1540. Egidivs Gormontivs.” I
know nothing of the author, except what is to bc
learned from the tract itself, that he was a kins-
man of the Cardinal, and had studied at Montagu
college in Paris, the great resort of our country-
meu in that age, and famous, in contemporary
satire, for its filth and vermin, its ill-aired cham-
bers, and unwholesome fare. ¹⁴ Trop mieulx sont
traictez,’' says the preceptor of Gmgantua, “les
foreez entre les Maures et Tartares, les meurtriers
en la prison crimfflelle, voyre certes les chiens en
vostre maison, que ne sont les malauctruz on dict
colliege.” (Rabelais, liure i. chap. xxxvii).

2 ‘⁸ Placebo Domino in regione vivorum,” the
last verse of the Psalm which the Vulgate reckons
cxiiij.; the ninth, of that which the English version
counts cxvi. It was used as the anthem at the
beginning of Vespers, in the Vigils (or non-sacrifi-
cial Service) for the Departed‚ and so gave name
to the whole ofthat office.

3 ’ἰ Dirige Domine Deus meus in conspectu tuo
viam mean]‚'’ llic anthem with which Matius be-
gan in the Vigils for the Departed. lt is taken
from the ninth verse of the fifth Psalm.

“ A Diriye autem (ut videtur) originem duxit
Anglicum Dirqe, id est menia? (Portiforii seu
Breviarii Sarisburiensis Fasciculus Primus, p.
xxxviii. Lond. 1843.)
