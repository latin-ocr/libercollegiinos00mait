cnsigns of the city, where it bas been enshrined
for more than five centuries. We discover it in the
earliest notice which has been preserved of the
burgh scal, the description, by Father Thomas
Innes of the Scotish College at Paris, of a eharter
of the year 1293, which is now lost: ‘⁶ Huic carte
appensa erant duo sigilla, quorum primum, scilicet
SIgillum communitatis Glasguensis, exhibet snpe-
rius caput episcopi et inferius tintinabulum
alterum vero amissum est.’' (Registrurn Episcopa-
tus Glasguensis, vol. i. p. cxxvi. not. 9.). We see
it figured on the seal of the city which is still
attached to a deed (printed below, p. 237, no. iiii.)
of the year 1325, and has been cngraved both in
the Liber Sancte Marie de Meiros, t. ii. plate vr.
no. 3. Edinb. 1837, and in the Registrum Episco-
patus Glasguensis, plate v. no. 3. An impression
from this 5831, which continued in use until the
Reformation, is included in the interesting collec—
tion of casts of Glasgow scals presented to the
members of the Maitland Club‚ in the year 1832,
by their secretary, Dr. Smith of Crutherland.
Saint Mungo's bell may be recognised also on the
privy seal of the chapter used in the year 1321
(Liber S. Mario de Melros, t. ii. plate v. no. 2;
Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis, plate 11. no.
2.); as well as on the seal of cause of the same
body used from the year 1488 to the year 1540
(Registrum Episcopatus GlasguensiS, plate vr.
no. 5.); on the latest chapter scal known to have
existed (ld. plate vr. no. 10.); and on the seal of
the officiality, used in the year 1533, and probably

as early as the close of the thirteenth century,
(ld. plate VI. no. 9.).

Ι need not stay here to explain “the fish and
the ring,’' which appear (along with the mitred
effigy of Saint Kendgern. and his consecrated bell)
un the burgh 5831 of the year 1325, and may be

period. They are intelligible emblems of a well-
kuown miracle which occupies a prominent place
in every memorial of the Saint. Cf. Pinkert.

But I may be permitted to offer one or two
remarks 011 the less generally understood tokens
ol' “the bird” and “the tree.’' These too are
represented on the seal of the municipal com-
munity in the year 1325, as well as on many of
the ancient 58315 os the episcopal see.

The bird is obviously the little favourite of
Saint Serf, the ‘⁴ avicula, quae vulgo ob ruborem
corpusculi Rubisca nuncupatur‚” the tale of whose
miraculous restoration to life by Saint Kenti·
gern, fills the fifth chapter os his Acts by
Jocelin (Pinkert. Vit. Antiq. SS. Scotiae, pp. 208-
210.), and is duly commemorated also in the
second lesson appointed for his festival in the
Breviary of Aberdeen, (Regist. Episc. Glasg.
vol. i. p. xc.). Long after this legend was wholly
forgotten‚ it was remembered that the bird ex-
hibited in the arms of the city was a red-breast,
as we learn from the inscription which Dr. Robert
Magnus has prefixed to his epigram ou the
Insiynia civitatis Glasyuae: “Salmo‚ quereus,
eui insidet rubecula avis, campana, et annulus
aureus salmonis ore exortus.'' (Artvri Ionstoni
Poemata Omnia, p. 434. Middelb. Zeland. 1642).

The ‘¹ tree‚” in the older 58315, takes the form
rather of a branch; and is doubtless meant to
commemorate the frozen bough of hazel which
Saint Kentigern miraculously kindled into flame,
as related in the third lesson preseribed for his

seen on seals of the bishops at a still earlier feast in the Aberdeen Breviary, (Regist. Epise.
