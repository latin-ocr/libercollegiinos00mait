lings yearly, from certain lands in the burgh of Rothesay, makes mention
ofa Sub Prior of the convent.⁵ The person who is so designed, appears
in a deed of the subsequent year, under the style simply of “ Friar
William Brounne‚ one of the Friars Preachers of Glasgow, and proctor
for the convent of the same.”⁶

In the year 1509, Sir Archibald Calderwood‚ vicar of Cadder, among
other pious bequests, left eight shillings yearly to the Black Friars, to sing
a “ Dirige” for him on the Feast of All Souls, with a mass on the morrow3
together with eight shillings to the regents and students of the neighbour-
ing Pedagogy or College, to appear at the service, such of them as were
priests taking part both in the ‘⁴ Dirige” and in the mass, the others saying
only the “Dirige.''⁷

Friar John Spense, bachelor in divinity, who, in the previous summer,
was superior of the house at Edinburgh‚⁸ appears as Prior of Glasgow in
the year 1517.⁹ To his time, perhaps, we may refer a copy(authenticated by
a notary’s signatore, but without date) of a bull of Pope Leo the Tenth‚ in
the year 1518, confirming the privileges of hearing confession and granting
absolution which had been conceded to the Mendicant Orders by several
of his predecessors in the chair of Saint Peter.¹ These immunities, by the
long and bitter strife which they stirred up between the parochial clergy
and the Begging Friars‚·2 had largely contributed to the event of the
