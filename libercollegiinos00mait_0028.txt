THE PREFACE.

these, eight poor scholars were to be present, to say either the Seven
Penitential Psalms, or the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mar-y,4 with the
Psalm “ De Profundis‚'’ and the usual collects3 and to each scholar were
to be given two pennies. Fourthly, the poor of both chambers of the
Hospital of Saint Nicholas beside the Cathedral, were to be invited as well
to the obsequies as to the mass, during which they were to repeat the
Rosary of Our Lady3 and four shillings were to be divided equally among
those present, or detained in the Almshouse by their infirmity. Fifthly‚
the lepers of Saint Ninian’s Hospital at the south end of the bridge over
the Clyde‚ were to assemble in the cemetery of the College, there to offer
up prayers to God3 and among them twelve pennies were to be doled.

Sixthly, Saint Mango’s bell⁵ was to be tolled through the city, both on

⁴ The devotion of the Rosary of Oui· Lady
consists in the recital of fifteen Pater Nosters, and
a hundred and fifty Ave Marias. Its origin has
afforded matter for a learned controversy, of which
brief notices may be seen in the reverend Alban
Butler's Lives of the Samis, (4 Aug. and l Oct.).
The Apostolic See appears to have ruled, that the
devotion (which was for the use chiefly of the more
illiterate) was instituted by Saint Dominic, in the
thirteenth century. (Breviarium Romanum ex
decreto SS. Concilii Tridentini restitutum Prop.
sanct„ Dominica prima Octobris, iu solemnitate
SS. Rosarii B. V. Mariae).

5 This bell, which the great Apostle of Strath-
clyde was believed to have brought with him
from Rome, was long held in much veneration
at Glasgow. It is repeatedly mentioned in the
following sheets (pp. 51, 52, 177, 196, 203, 209.)
as well as in the Registrum Episcopatus Glas-
guensis (vol. ii. pp. 314, 406, 416, 419, 523, 589,
552.); and allusion to it occurS, more than once, in
the ancient offices sor the festival of the Saint-

the Breviary of Aberdeen:

“ Visitat alma pii vite septena loca Petri
Presul campana cui seruit in ethere sacra.''

xciv.) ,Ag-ain, another hymn, which Mr. Innes

conjectures to be of the fifteenth century:

“ Romam visit septies: papa quem honorat
Ut seruiret presuli : avi se decorat
Et campanam sustinet: que sonos dulcorat.’'

(Id. p. xcix.) The life of Saint Mung0,written by
Jocelin of Furues in the twelfth century, and edited
by Pinkerton‚has a chapter “ Quod Sanctus Ken-
tegernus septies Romam adierit3 que Beatum Gre-
gorium de statu suo consulerit;’' and though no
express mention is here made of the bell, we may
be allowed to suppose that it was meant to be
included among the “multa sanctorum pignora,
et ecclesiae ornamenta, et cetera quae ad decorem
domus Dei pertinuerunt‚” which the bishop is said
to have received from the hands of the sainted suc-
cessor of Saint Peter. (Vitae Antiquae Sanctorum
Scotiae, pp. 255-257. Lond. 1789). The bell of
Saint Kentigern was one of the few memorials of
the old worship which escaped the wreck of the
Reformation. In the accounts of the city treasurer
