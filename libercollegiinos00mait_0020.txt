The Sacristan,

THE PREFACE.

xvi

The second prebend was that of the Greater Sacrist‚ whose duties
the Foundation sets forth in considerable detail. He was to keep the books,
chalices, copes, vestments‚ and ornaments, both of the high altar and of the
other altars in the church3 to bring them to the choir in time of divine
service3 and to deliver them to the persons officiating, either by himself
or by a servant wearing a surplice. He was to have a clerk under him to
ring the bells at the appointed times, and to supply the church with fire
and water. He himself was fai-ther charged generally with preserving both
church and chancel in all decency and cleanness3 with fighting the candles
on the high altar and on the “heirss,”³ and extinguishing them, at the
proper seasons; and with seeing that the church linen was duly washed and
mended once a-year. His stipend was one half of the fruits of the vicarage
of Mayboill. Certain revenues also were set apart for providing candles of
tallow to light the church in the winter season, from Allhallowmass or the
Feast of All Saints (the first of November), or earlier if need were, to
Candlemass or the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin (the

second of February); as well as for finding the College in wax lights,

⁸ This term is still used in our northern shires in the fourteenth century, to havepbeen called the
to denote, as in Franco, a pendent chandclier; perfi. In a dced ol the year 1387, this passage
but in the passage in the text (p. ⁶25), and, perhaps, occurs : “ Item de terris predictis inuenirentur
generally until after the Reformation, the ⁴·heirss” quattuor clerici in ecclesia parochiali de Ellon cum
cappis ct superpellicijs qui scirent sufficienter

legere et cantare · Item quarta pars de Eister

would appear to have been the name given to a
bench, bier or stage in the chancel on which

lights were placed. Thus, in a record of the year
1560, mention is made of ¹¹ xviij brassin chandlaris
quhilk stuid one the lang· berse in the qucir of
Sanct Nicholace parroehe kirk; tua gryt chand-
laris of Sanct Nicholass hie altar, with the sacra-
rnent chandlar‚’⁷etc. (Extracts from the Council
Register of the Burgli of Aberdeen, 1398-1570,
pp. 328,329. Aberdeen: Priuted for the Spald-
ing Club. 1845.).

The same article ofecclesiastical furuiture seemS,

Ellone tenetur inuenire domum pro scolaribus
apud Ellon · Item quarta pars de Candellan tene-
tur inuenire super le perfi coram magno altarj vi-
ginti quatuor candelas sufficientes et has [bis] in
anno tenetur renouare.” (Registrum Episcopatus
Aberdonensis, vol. i. p. 178. Edinb. 1845). The
context, perhapS, might warrant a conjecture that
“ le pcrfi '³ bore some relation to the “ parvisium’'
of Matthew Paris, if not to “the parvise'’ which
has perplexed the commentators on Chaucer.
