THE PREFACE. xlvii

From the period at which we now arrive, the existing muniments of Succession ω

the convent enable us to trace the succession of its Priors, although,
perhaps, not in a perfect or altogether uubroken line.

The first name on the roll is that of Friar James Boyd, who appears as
superior of the house in the year 1430, and had ceascd to rule it before
the year 14:34. During his time, Sir William of Forfare, Prior of the
Augustinian Canons chular of Blantyre‚ bequeathed to the brethren, a
tenement on the west side of the High Street of Glasgow3⁵ and Alan
Stewart‚ lord of Dernley, made over to them an annuity of twenty shillings
from the lands of Cathkert, in satisfaction‚ it would appear, of a hundred
crowns of gold which had been lent to his father, Sir John Stewart, by
Friar Alan Lokart‚ from the common purse of the convent.⁰

In the beginning of the year 1434, Friar Oswald was Prior.
In consideration of a rood of land on the east side of the High Street,
conveyed to the convent by ,John Flemyng of the Cowglen, he undertakes
on the part of himself and his brethren to pay ten shillings yearly, and to
find stabling for two horses, “tyll the said John Flemyn, qwhen hym
lykis tyll cum tyll do hys erandis, within the town; and attour, gyf it
lykis the said Johne tyll cum and dwell within Glasgu, the said Priour
sall byg tyll the said John an honest hall chamir and butler, with a yard
for to set cale in, sic as afferis in thir thyngis till the said John till be
herberijt in.'’⁷ The deed supplies, probably, the earliest specimen which
has been preserved of the vernacular speech of the people of Saint
